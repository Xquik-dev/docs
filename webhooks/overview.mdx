Webhooks deliver events from monitored X accounts to your server in real time. Every delivery is signed with HMAC-SHA256 so you can verify authenticity.

## Quick Setup

Get webhooks working in 3 steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a monitor">
    Start monitoring an X account for specific event types.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://xquik.com/api/v1/monitors \
      -H "x-api-key: xq_YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "username": "elonmusk",
        "eventTypes": ["tweet.new", "tweet.reply"]
      }' | jq
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a webhook">
    Provide an HTTPS URL and select which event types to receive. Xquik generates a signing secret -- store it securely, it is only returned once.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://xquik.com/api/v1/webhooks \
      -H "x-api-key: xq_YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
        "eventTypes": ["tweet.new", "tweet.reply"]
      }' | jq
    ```

    **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "id": "15",
      "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
      "eventTypes": ["tweet.new", "tweet.reply"],
      "secret": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-24T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify signatures">
    When events arrive, verify the `X-Xquik-Signature` header using your webhook secret to confirm authenticity. See [Signature Verification](/webhooks/verification) for implementation details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

```text
X Account Activity → Xquik Stream → Your Webhook Endpoint
```

## Delivery Format

Webhook events are delivered as HTTPS POST requests.

### Headers

| Header | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Payload is always JSON |
| `X-Xquik-Signature` | `sha256=HMAC_HEX_DIGEST` | HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification |

### Payload Body

```json
{
  "eventType": "tweet.new",
  "username": "elonmusk",
  "data": {
    "tweetId": "1893456789012345678",
    "text": "The future is now.",
    "metrics": {
      "likes": 42000,
      "retweets": 8500,
      "replies": 3200
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `eventType` | string | Event type (see below) |
| `username` | string | X username of the monitored account |
| `data` | object | Event-specific payload (varies by type) |

## Event Data Shapes

Each event type includes a `data` object with type-specific fields.

### tweet.new

```json
{
  "eventType": "tweet.new",
  "username": "elonmusk",

    "text": "The future is now.",
    "metrics": {
      "likes": 42000,
      "retweets": 8500,
      "replies": 3200

## Retry Policy

Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff (base 1s, multiplier 2x):

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | 1 second |
| 2 | 2 seconds |
| 3 | 4 seconds |
| 4 | 8 seconds |
| 5 | 16 seconds |

After 5 failed attempts, the delivery is marked as `exhausted`. Check delivery status via the [deliveries endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/deliveries).

## Requirements

- Endpoint **must** use HTTPS
- Endpoint **must** respond with `2xx` within 10 seconds
- Non-2xx responses or timeouts count as failures
